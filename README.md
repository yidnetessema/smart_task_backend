# SmartTask Spring Boot Backend Application

## Overview
SmartTask is a lightweight, scalable **Spring Boot** application designed to manage and automate smart tasks using a modern **RESTful API**. It leverages the **Spring Boot ecosystem** to provide a robust backend for **task creation, scheduling, prioritization, and tracking**.

## Features
- **Task Management**: Create, update, and delete tasks with attributes like priority, due dates, and status.
- **Smart Automation**: Intelligent task categorization and assignment based on predefined rules or user input.
- **Database Integration**: Uses **Spring Data JPA** with an embedded **H2 database** (configurable for PostgreSQL) for persistence.
- **Kafka-Powered Email Service**: Implements **Apache Kafka** for asynchronous email notifications (task assignments, completions, or overdue alerts).
- **RESTful API Endpoints**: Seamless integration with front-end applications or external services.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful exception management and meaningful response codes for better debugging.

## Tech Stack
- **Java 17+**
- **Spring Boot 3.x**
- **Maven** for dependency management
- **H2 Database** (in-memory, configurable for PostgreSQL)
- **Lombok** for reducing boilerplate code
- **Apache Kafka** for event-driven notifications
