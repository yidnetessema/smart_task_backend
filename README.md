Project Name: SmartTask Spring Boot Backend Application

Description:

A lightweight, scalable Spring Boot application designed to manage and automate "smart tasks" with a modern RESTful API. This project leverages Spring Boot's powerful ecosystem to provide a robust backend for task creation, scheduling, prioritization, and tracking. Key features include:

Task Management: Create, update, and delete tasks with dynamic attributes like priority, due dates, and status.
Smart Automation: Built-in logic to intelligently categorize and assign tasks based on predefined rules or user input.
Database Integration: Uses Spring Data JPA with an embedded H2 database (configurable for PostgreSQL) for persistence.
Kafka-Powered Email Service: Utilizes Apache Kafka for asynchronous email notifications, ensuring reliable and scalable delivery of task-related updates (e.g., task assigned, completed, or overdue).
API Endpoints: Exposes RESTful endpoints for seamless integration with front-end applications or external services.
Error Handling: Graceful exception management and meaningful response codes for better debugging and user experience.
Tech Stack:

Java 17+
Spring Boot 3.x
Maven for dependency management
H2 Database (in-memory, with options to extend)
Lombok for cleaner code
